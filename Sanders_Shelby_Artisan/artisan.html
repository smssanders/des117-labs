    <h1>Bettie Page</h1>
    
    <p>Bettie Page is considered the Queen of Pinups. She became a prominent model in the 1950's. Her jet black hair, blue eyes, and trademark bangs have influenced artists for generations. Bettie Page has continued to inspire people even today; she is an iconic figure for both women and men. She had the ability to encourage women and promote body positivity, a quality that her fans still get from her photographs. 
    
    <p>Page was born in <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong> on April 22, <i>1923</i>. She was the second of six children and had a rough childhood. Her parents divorced when she was 10 years old and she reported being molested by her father at 13. After his arrest, Page's mother worked two jobs to support her children. Page taught herself skills such as sewing, and makeup; which was useful to her future modeling career. She made her own lingerie and swimsuits, as well as did her own hair and makeup for her photoshoots.</p>
    

    <p>Her photographs have been seen all over the world, and she was the centerfold for Playboy in the January 1955 issue. Even though she was a professional nude model, her photographs have a great sense of class to them and they remain timeless. Her playfulness and innocence were captured in many of her photos, as well as confidence and female dominance in her bondage photos. She retired from modeling around 1958, when she became deeply religious and involved in numerous churches. Her later life however, was more tragic. She suffered from depression and violent mood swings, and spent several years in a psychiatric hospital. She suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and died after a heart attack on December 11<sup>th</sup>, 2008.</p>
